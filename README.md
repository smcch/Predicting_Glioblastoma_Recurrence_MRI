## Overall idea

This model uses as input the voxelwise radiomic features of the non-enhancing peritumoral region of glioblastomas extracted from multiparametric structural MRI. As output, the probability for each voxel of becoming a site of future tumor recurrence is obtained. The probabilities are represented through color-coded maps. In addition, a segmentation of the regions identified as high-risk by the model is generated.

## Prerequisites

Raw MRI sequences need to be pre-processed according to the following pipeline: https://github.com/smcch/Postoperative-Glioblastoma-Segmentation

After preprocessing, segmentation of the following structures is mandatory: a) peritumoral region, b) tumor core (enhancing volume + necrosis) or surgical cavity depending on whether it is a preoperative or postoperative study.

Below is an example of the volumes and segmentation that will be used as input, and the model's output (recurrence probability map).

## How to use

### Python

##### Requirements

In order to run this code, Python 3.9.15 or above is required. The Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` are also necessary. One can install them by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A folder named `Patients` containing the patients' data to be analysed is expected to be placed in the same folder as the code. `Patients` should contain a subfolder for each of the patients. Each patient's folder must contain:

* t1ce.nii.gz
* t1.nii.gz
* t2.nii.gz
* flair.nii.gz
* adc.nii.gz
* peritumor.nii.gz
* tumor.nii.gz **_OR_** cavity.nii.gz


#### Usage

The main function is in `main.py`, and to run the code over all the patients, one must run 
```
python main.py
```
from within the code folder. Once the script is done, each patient will have their results stored within their respective subfolder.
